# AccelByte UE4 Sample Project

## Overview
Using UE4 Version 4.21.3
Using AccelByte Services SDK Version 2.14.0

[Shooter Game](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Resources/SampleGames/ShooterGame/index.html) is an example of a PC multiplayer first-person shooter from [Epic Games](https://www.epicgames.com/). We are using this sample game to integrate AccelByteâ€™s services we add new menus to show chasing each service available.
The game project will only work on UE4 version 4.21. If you are going to build a game server also then we recommend using UE4 version 4.21 from source. If you are only going to build a game client then UE4 version 4.21 from Epic Launcher is faster to set up.
We are using UMG for some menus and some slate from the original shooter game.
The menu that using UMG currently are :
Login Menu (ShooterGame\Source\ShooterGame\Private\UI\UMG\LoginMenuUI.cpp)
