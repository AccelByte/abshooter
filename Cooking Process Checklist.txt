- For Game Maps under Content, there's few Maps with Suffix _Lightning, _Gameplay, etc, those are used to separate the level to not make it a massive blob.
- example usage, Lightning Engineer can develop on the map using _Lightning, Gameplay engineer on _Gameplay, without them conflicting with each other.
- To set these map and see what level is inside the map, you can use Window->Levels, to add a map, you can use the top left of Levels icon and use ..add existing

- Disabling -pak options in Cooking might help to debug if asset is missing, -pak will package the Assets into one file (with smaller size), usually used for Shipping releases.
- If you built a Server/Game with pak previously, remove the Pak folder afterwards, otherwise it will still be read by the game (creates duplicates issues)
